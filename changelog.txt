changelog:
-changed update_columns to update_slots to improve clarity
-created an update_column function to reduce repeated code
-moved the handling of pops to happen after a turn is taken so only the relevant column is updated and updates only happen after the board is changed instead of constantly
-added process_scores and process_score to update the column totals
-added grand total scores for both boards (in the silliest way possible...)
-created end_game function to end the game when a board is filled
